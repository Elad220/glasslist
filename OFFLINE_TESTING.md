## Manual Testing Steps

### 1. Test Offline Mode
1. Open the app in your browser

3. Go to Network tab
4. Check "Offline" checkbox to simulate offline mode
5. Try to:
   - View your shopping lists
   - Add new items
   - Edit existing items
   - Check/uncheck items
   - Create new lists

### 2. Test Sync Behavior
1. Make changes while offline
2. Uncheck "Offline" in Network tab
3. Watch for automatic sync
4. Check the sync indicators in the UI

### 3. Test PWA Installation
1. Look for the install prompt (usually appears after a few visits)
2. Click "Install" to add to home screen
3. Test the app from the installed version

### 4. Test Service Worker
1. Open Developer Tools
2. Go to Application tab
3. Check "Service Workers" section

## Expected Behavior

### When Online:

- âœ… No pending changes indicator

### When Offline:
- âœ… Orange indicator showing "Offline"
- âœ… Changes saved locally
- âœ… Pending changes counter increases

- âœ… Retry logic for failed syncs
- âœ… Conflict resolution for simultaneous edits

## Troubleshooting

### If IndexedDB fails:
- Check browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Clear browser data and try again
- Check for private/incognito mode restrictions

### If Service Worker fails:
- Check browser support
- Clear site data and reload
- Check for HTTPS requirement (required for service workers)

### If sync fails:
- Check network connectivity
- Check Supabase credentials
- Check browser console for errors

## Browser Support

- âœ… Safari 11.1+
- âœ… Edge 17+

## Notes
