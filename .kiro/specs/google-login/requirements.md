# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds Google OAuth authentication to the shopping list application, allowing users to sign in using their Google accounts. This will provide a seamless authentication experience and leverage Google's secure authentication infrastructure while maintaining compatibility with the existing Supabase authentication system.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to sign in with my Google account, so that I can quickly access the application without creating a separate account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the authentication page THEN the system SHALL display a "Sign in with Google" button
2. WHEN a user clicks the "Sign in with Google" button THEN the system SHALL redirect to Google's OAuth consent screen
3. WHEN a user grants permission on Google's consent screen THEN the system SHALL redirect back to the application with authentication tokens
4. WHEN Google authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL create or update the user profile in Supabase
5. WHEN Google authentication is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the dashboard

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an existing user with a Google account, I want to link my Google account to my existing profile, so that I can use either authentication method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authenticated user accesses account settings THEN the system SHALL display an option to link Google account
2. WHEN a user links their Google account THEN the system SHALL associate the Google identity with their existing Supabase profile
3. WHEN a user has linked their Google account THEN the system SHALL allow sign-in using either method
4. IF a user attempts to link a Google account already associated with another profile THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error message

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want my Google profile information to be used for my account, so that my display name and avatar are automatically populated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user signs in with Google for the first time THEN the system SHALL populate their profile with Google display name
2. WHEN a user signs in with Google for the first time THEN the system SHALL populate their profile with Google profile picture
3. WHEN a user's Google profile information changes THEN the system SHALL update the local profile on next sign-in
4. WHEN a user has both local and Google profile information THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most recently updated information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want secure and reliable Google authentication, so that my account remains protected and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing Google OAuth THEN the system SHALL use secure HTTPS connections for all authentication flows
2. WHEN storing authentication tokens THEN the system SHALL follow Supabase security best practices
3. WHEN Google authentication fails THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages to the user
4. WHEN Google authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options to sign in with email/password
5. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL properly revoke Google authentication tokens

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want Google authentication to integrate seamlessly with existing features, so that all current functionality continues to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user authenticates via Google THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with existing RLS policies
2. WHEN a user authenticates via Google THEN the system SHALL preserve access to their existing shopping lists
3. WHEN a user authenticates via Google THEN the system SHALL maintain sharing and collaboration features
4. WHEN implementing Google auth THEN the system SHALL not break existing email/password authentication
5. WHEN a user switches between authentication methods THEN the system SHALL maintain session continuity
