## Technical Implementation

### Prerequisites

- Google Gemini API key configured in user profile
- AI suggestions enabled in user settings
- Shopping history data available

### Dependencies

```typescript
import { GoogleGenerativeAI } from '@google/generative-ai'
import { supabase } from '../lib/supabase/client'
import { useToast } from '../lib/toast/context'
```

### API Integration

All components use the Google Gemini 1.5 Flash model for AI analysis:

```typescript
const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(apiKey)
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-1.5-flash' })
```

### Data Analysis

Components analyze shopping data including:
- Item frequency and patterns
- Category spending distribution
- Completion rates and efficiency
- Temporal trends and seasonality
- Shopping list performance

### Fallback Mechanisms

Each component includes fallback functionality when:
- API key is not available
- AI analysis fails
- Insufficient data exists
- Network errors occur

## Usage

### Dashboard Integration

The components are automatically integrated into the dashboard sidebar when:
- User has a valid Gemini API key
- AI suggestions are enabled
- Sufficient shopping data exists

### Component Hierarchy

```jsx
{/* AI-Powered Insights */}
{user && profile?.ai_suggestions_enabled && profile?.gemini_api_key ? (
  <GenAIInsights 
    userId={user.id}
    apiKey={profile?.gemini_api_key || ''}
    analytics={analytics}
    shoppingLists={shoppingLists}
    onRefresh={() => {
      if (!isDemoMode) {
        fetchAnalytics(user.id)
      }
    }}
  />
) : (
  /* Basic Insights Fallback */
)}

{/* Smart Shopping Tips */}
{user && profile?.ai_suggestions_enabled && profile?.gemini_api_key && (
  <SmartShoppingTips 
    userId={user.id}
    apiKey={profile?.gemini_api_key || ''}
    analytics={analytics}
    shoppingLists={shoppingLists}
  />
)}

{/* AI Shopping Analytics */}
{user && profile?.ai_suggestions_enabled && profile?.gemini_api_key && (
  <AIShoppingAnalytics 
    userId={user.id}
    apiKey={profile?.gemini_api_key || ''}
    analytics={analytics}
    shoppingLists={shoppingLists}
  />
)}
```

## AI Prompt Engineering

### GenAI Insights Prompt

The AI is prompted to analyze shopping data and generate contextual insights:

```
You are a smart shopping analytics assistant. Analyze the user's shopping data and provide 3-5 intelligent insights.

Shopping Data:
- Total items purchased: {total_items}
- Completed items: {completed_items}
- Total lists: {total_lists}
- Most frequent category: {most_frequent_category}
- Items this month: {items_this_month}

Generate 3-5 intelligent insights about their shopping patterns. Consider:
1. Trends in their shopping behavior
2. Categories they might be neglecting
3. Items they buy frequently but might be running low on
4. Shopping efficiency and completion patterns
5. Seasonal or contextual recommendations
```

### Smart Shopping Tips Prompt

The AI generates personalized shopping advice:

```
You are a smart shopping advisor. Analyze the user's shopping data and provide 4-6 personalized shopping tips.

Generate 4-6 personalized shopping tips. Consider:
1. Efficiency improvements (batching, planning, timing)
2. Cost savings opportunities
3. Organization and list management
4. Health and nutrition optimization
5. Seasonal shopping strategies
6. Completion rate improvements
```

### AI Shopping Analytics Prompt

The AI provides advanced analytics and trends:

```
You are a shopping analytics expert. Analyze the user's shopping data and provide advanced metrics and trends.

Generate 5-6 advanced shopping metrics and 3-4 trend insights. Consider:
1. Shopping efficiency and patterns
2. Category diversity and preferences
3. Completion rates and productivity
4. Seasonal trends and predictions
5. Cost optimization opportunities
6. Time management insights
```

## Error Handling

### API Failures
