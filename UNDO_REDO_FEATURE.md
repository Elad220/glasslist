# Simplified Undo/Redo Feature Implementation

## Overview

The undo/redo feature has been simplified to provide a more contextual and user-friendly experience. Instead of global undo/redo buttons, the system now shows undo buttons directly in the toast notifications when items or lists are deleted.

## Features

### Supported Actions
- **Delete Item**: Undo deleting items from shopping lists
- **Delete List**: Undo deleting entire shopping lists

### User Interface
- **Toast-based Undo**: Undo buttons appear directly in success toasts after deletions
- **Contextual**: Only shows when relevant (after delete operations)
- **Simple**: No complex keyboard shortcuts or global buttons needed

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
The simplified system uses a lightweight undo manager that:
- Tracks recent delete actions
- Provides undo functionality through toast actions
- Maintains a small history (max 10 actions)

### Key Components

#### 1. Simple Undo Manager (`src/lib/undo-redo/simple.ts`)
- Lightweight class-based undo manager
- Tracks delete actions with execution functions
- Provides helper functions for common undo scenarios

#### 2. Enhanced Toast System (`src/lib/toast/context.tsx`)
- Added support for action buttons in toasts
- Integrated with undo functionality
- Maintains existing toast styling and behavior

### Integration Points

#### Dashboard Page (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- List deletion with undo toast
- Simplified integration without complex state management

#### List Page (`src/app/list/[listId]/page.tsx`)
- Item deletion with undo toast
- Clean, contextual undo experience

## Usage

### For Users
1. **Delete an item or list** - Normal delete operation
2. **See undo toast** - Success toast appears with "Undo" button
3. **Click Undo** - Item/list is restored immediately
4. **Confirmation** - Success toast confirms the undo action

### For Developers
1. **Import the undo manager**: `import { undoManager, createDeleteItemUndoAction } from '@/lib/undo-redo/simple'`
2. **Create undo action**: Use helper functions to create undo actions
3. **Show toast with action**: Use the enhanced toast system with action buttons

## Example Implementation

```typescript
// Create undo action
const undoAction = await createDeleteItemUndoAction(listId, item, itemId, () => {
  // Refresh data after undo
  loadData()
})
undoManager.addAction(undoAction)

// Show toast with undo button
toast.success(
  'Item removed', 
  `${item.name} removed from your list`,
  {
    action: {
      label: 'Undo',
      onClick: async () => {
        const latestAction = undoManager.getLatestAction()
        if (latestAction && latestAction.id === undoAction.id) {
          await latestAction.execute()
          undoManager.removeAction(latestAction.id)
          toast.success('Undone', `${item.name} has been restored`)
        }
      }
    }
  }
)
```

## Benefits of Simplified Approach

1. **Contextual**: Undo only appears when relevant
2. **Intuitive**: Users see undo option immediately after action
3. **Lightweight**: No complex state management or global UI
4. **Focused**: Only handles the most important undo scenario (deletions)
5. **Maintainable**: Simple codebase with clear responsibilities

## Configuration

### History Size
The maximum number of actions stored can be configured in `src/lib/undo-redo/simple.ts`:

```typescript
class UndoManager {
  private maxActions = 10  // Change this value
}
```

### Toast Duration
Toast duration can be configured in the toast system:

```typescript
const duration = toast.duration || 4000  // 4 seconds default
```

## Error Handling

- **Database Errors**: Failed undo operations show error toasts
- **State Consistency**: Optimistic updates with rollback on errors
- **Network Issues**: Graceful handling of connection problems

## Future Enhancements

1. **More Actions**: Extend to support editing operations
2. **Persistent History**: Save undo history to localStorage
3. **Bulk Operations**: Support for undoing multiple actions
4. **Visual Indicators**: Show which items have been modified recently

## Testing

The feature can be tested by:
1. Deleting items from shopping lists
2. Deleting shopping lists from dashboard
3. Using the undo buttons in the toast notifications
4. Verifying that items/lists are properly restored

## Dependencies

- React 19.1.0+
- TypeScript 5+
- Existing Supabase client functions
- Enhanced toast notification system
