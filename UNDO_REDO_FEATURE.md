# Undo/Redo Feature Implementation

## Overview

The undo/redo feature has been successfully implemented in the GlassList shopping list application. This feature allows users to undo accidental deletions or changes to their shopping lists and items.

## Features

### Supported Actions
- **Add Item**: Undo adding items to shopping lists
- **Delete Item**: Undo deleting items from shopping lists  
- **Update Item**: Undo editing item details (name, amount, unit, category, notes, image)
- **Toggle Item**: Undo checking/unchecking items
- **Delete List**: Undo deleting entire shopping lists
- **Update List**: Undo editing list details (name, description, sharing settings)

### User Interface
- **Undo/Redo Buttons**: Available in both dashboard and individual list pages
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: 
  - `Ctrl+Z` (or `Cmd+Z` on Mac) for Undo
  - `Ctrl+Y` or `Ctrl+Shift+Z` for Redo
- **History Viewer**: Dropdown showing recent actions with timestamps
- **Visual Feedback**: Toast notifications for successful undo/redo operations

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
The undo/redo system uses a state machine pattern with three states:
- **Past**: Completed actions that can be undone
- **Present**: Current state
- **Future**: Actions that can be redone

### Key Components

#### 1. Context Provider (`src/lib/undo-redo/context.tsx`)
- Manages the undo/redo state using React useReducer
- Provides context for the entire application
- Handles action history with configurable maximum size (default: 50 actions)

#### 2. Action Types (`src/lib/undo-redo/types.ts`)
- Defines TypeScript interfaces for actions and state
- Supports all shopping list operations

#### 3. Action Execution (`src/lib/undo-redo/actions.ts`)
- Handles the actual database operations for undo/redo
- Integrates with Supabase client functions
- Provides error handling and rollback capabilities

#### 4. Custom Hooks (`src/lib/undo-redo/hooks.ts`)
- `useUndoRedoWithExecution`: Main hook for undo/redo operations
- `useItemActions`: Helper for item-specific actions
- `useListActions`: Helper for list-specific actions

#### 5. UI Components
- `UndoRedoButtons`: Main undo/redo button component
- `UndoRedoHistory`: History viewer component for debugging

### Integration Points

#### Dashboard Page (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`)
- Undo/redo buttons in header
- Integration with list deletion and editing operations
- History viewer for debugging

#### List Page (`src/app/list/[listId]/page.tsx`)
- Undo/redo buttons in list header
- Integration with item operations (add, delete, edit, toggle)
- History viewer for debugging

## Usage

### For Users
1. **Undo**: Click the undo button or press `Ctrl+Z`
2. **Redo**: Click the redo button or press `Ctrl+Y`
3. **View History**: Click the history button to see recent actions
4. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Work globally except when typing in input fields

### For Developers
1. **Adding New Actions**: Use the provided hooks in your components
2. **Custom Actions**: Extend the action types and execution logic
3. **Testing**: Use the history viewer to verify action tracking

## Configuration

### History Size
The maximum number of actions stored in history can be configured in `src/lib/undo-redo/context.tsx`:

```typescript
const initialState: UndoRedoState = {
  past: [],
  present: null,
  future: [],
  maxHistorySize: 50  // Change this value
}
```

### Demo Mode Support
The undo/redo system works in both demo mode and production mode, with appropriate fallbacks for demo operations.

## Error Handling

- **Database Errors**: Failed undo/redo operations show error toasts
- **State Consistency**: Optimistic updates with rollback on errors
- **Network Issues**: Graceful handling of connection problems

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persistent History**: Save undo history to localStorage for session persistence
2. **Bulk Operations**: Support for undoing multiple actions at once
3. **Action Grouping**: Group related actions (e.g., AI bulk add)
4. **Visual Indicators**: Show which items have been modified recently
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Handle concurrent edits in shared lists

## Testing

The feature can be tested by:
1. Performing various actions (add, delete, edit items/lists)
2. Using undo/redo buttons and keyboard shortcuts
3. Checking the history viewer for action tracking
4. Verifying database state after undo/redo operations

## Dependencies

- React 19.1.0+
- TypeScript 5+
